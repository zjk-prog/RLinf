Adding a Robot
==============

This guide adds a mobile base, composes it with RLinf's existing Franka arm, and
drives the resulting mobile manipulator through a real-world Gymnasium
environment. By the end, the base will have a registered backend, a declared
observation and action contract, a reusable robot builder, cluster configuration,
and tests that run before the physical platform moves.

The work proceeds through four checkpoints. First, make one local part complete
its own lifecycle and data exchange. Next, compose it with existing parts and use
the result in a task. Then move the same declaration into configuration,
registration, and placement. Finally, verify the contract, the remote mock path,
and the real device in that order. Keeping these checkpoints separate makes a
failure point to one layer.

Before continuing, read :doc:`Robotics Interface <../concepts/robotics>`. If RLinf
already knows how to connect the hardware and you only need a new reward, reset,
or success condition, follow :doc:`New Real-World Tasks <new_task>` instead.

1. Implement the Mobile Base Locally
------------------------------------

A mobile base is one controllable robot part: it reports its pose and accepts a
velocity command. This section implements that contract in lifecycle order:
record the declaration, open and release the device, declare the data schema,
then read, reset, and command it. Inherit ``MobileBase`` so callers and builders
can rely on that category rather than a vendor class.

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np

   from rlinf.robotics import MobileBase


   @MobileBase.register("example")
   class ExampleMobileBase(MobileBase):
       def __init__(self, endpoint: str):
           self.endpoint = endpoint

       def _open(self):
           from example_mobile_sdk import Client

           return Client(self.endpoint)

       def _release(self, device) -> None:
           try:
               device.stop()
           finally:
               device.close()

       @property
       def observation_features(self) -> dict:
           return {"pose": {"shape": (3,), "dtype": "float32"}}

       @property
       def action_features(self) -> dict:
           return {"velocity": {"shape": (2,), "dtype": "float32"}}

       def reset(self) -> None:
           self._device.stop()

       def get_observation(self) -> dict[str, np.ndarray]:
           pose = np.asarray(self._device.get_pose(), dtype=np.float32)
           return {"pose": pose}

       def send_action(
           self, action: dict[str, np.ndarray]
       ) -> dict[str, np.ndarray]:
           if set(action) != {"velocity"}:
               raise KeyError("Expected only 'velocity'.")
           velocity = np.asarray(action["velocity"], dtype=np.float32)
           if velocity.shape != (2,):
               raise ValueError(f"Expected velocity shape (2,), got {velocity.shape}.")
           self._device.set_velocity(
               linear=float(velocity[0]),
               angular=float(velocity[1]),
           )
           return {"velocity": velocity}

Read the class from declaration to use. ``__init__()`` records only the endpoint;
it must not open hardware because construction and connection may occur in
different processes. ``_open()`` imports the vendor SDK at the node that owns
the connection and returns its client. That client becomes ``self._device``
while connected, and the same object is later passed to ``_release(device)``.

``observation_features`` and ``action_features`` declare the interface before a
device is open. Here ``pose`` is ``[x, y, yaw]`` and ``velocity`` is
``[linear_velocity, angular_velocity]``. ``get_observation()`` and
``send_action()`` must return values with those names, shapes, and dtypes;
``send_action()`` returns the velocity actually applied. ``reset()`` handles the
out-of-band stop used when an episode resets. Choose stable physical names and
units rather than exposing vendor method names as policy fields.

Finally, ``@MobileBase.register("example")`` gives the driver the backend name
used by configuration. Code with the concrete class can instantiate it directly;
a builder calls ``MobileBase.backend("example")`` to resolve the same class. This
registry names interchangeable mobile-base drivers. A later section registers
the complete robot composition separately.

Connect the base directly before composing it with anything else:

.. code-block:: python

   base = ExampleMobileBase("tcp://mobile-base:7000")
   base.connect()
   try:
       print(base.get_observation())
       base.send_action(
           {"velocity": np.array([0.1, 0.0], dtype=np.float32)}
       )
   finally:
       base.disconnect()

This direct check exercises the public sequence before composition adds any
other variable. ``connect()`` calls ``_open()``, the two data methods use
``self._device``, and ``disconnect()`` passes that handle to ``_release()``.
Both lifecycle calls are idempotent in the base class; preserve that property if
the device needs additional cleanup.

.. warning::

   A mobile base can keep moving after the Python process loses contact. Make
   the hardware controller enforce command timeouts and velocity limits, and
   send a stop command from ``_release`` as a final software safeguard.

2. Compose It with an Existing Arm
----------------------------------

The base is useful on its own, but it should not require a new arm driver. Build
a mobile manipulator by placing the base beside parts backed by the existing
Franka connection:

.. code-block:: python

   from rlinf.robotics import Arm, FrankaRobot, Robot


   class MobileManipulator(Robot):
       ROBOT_TYPE = "MobileManipulator"


   base = ExampleMobileBase(
       "tcp://mobile-base:7000",
       node_rank=0,
       worker_name="ExampleMobileBase-0-0",
   )
   arm_parts = FrankaRobot.build_arms(
       robot_ip="10.0.0.2",
       node_rank=0,
       worker_rank=0,
       env_idx=0,
   )
   robot = MobileManipulator(
       base=base,
       **arm_parts,
   )

The three declarations reach ``MobileManipulator`` in one form. Constructing
the mobile base returns an unconnected ``RobotPart``. ``build_arms()`` returns
a dictionary with the standard keys ``arm`` and ``end_effector``; each value is
an unconnected ``RobotPart``. Expanding that mapping passes both parts to the
robot. A
``Robot`` accepts one ``RobotPart`` or nested ``PartGroup`` for each keyword,
and each keyword becomes that value's public path. The resulting paths are
therefore ``base``, ``arm``, and ``end_effector``.

The Franka builder returns the hand separately because it opens its own
connection. An arm whose gripper uses the arm's bus instead carries that
gripper as a child, so composing the arm also creates
``arm.end_effector``. Communication ownership, rather than the mechanical
mounting point, determines which layout a builder returns.

Use ``declare_arm()`` and ``declare_end_effector()`` separately when the
standard names do not fit or the two connections need different placement.
There is one other case: a shared session may be a bare ``Connection`` that
cannot return observations itself. Select a readable part first, for example
``session.part("left")``, and pass that returned ``RobotPart`` to the robot.
``PartGroup`` rejects a bare, non-readable connection during construction and
names the invalid keyword in the error.

Replacing ``FrankaRobot.build_arms`` with another robot family's part builder,
or wrapping several arm parts in a ``PartGroup``, does not change the mobile base.
The composition defines the robot; no base-specific arm slot or mobile-arm
subclass is required by the framework.

Check those names and their resource ownership before opening hardware:

.. code-block:: text

   >>> print(robot.describe())
   MobileManipulator
   ├── base           ExampleMobileBase    node=0     via ExampleMobileBase#1
   ├── arm            FrankaROSArm         node=0     via FrankaROSArm#2
   └── end_effector   FrankaGripper        node=0     via FrankaGripper#3

Three parts, three ``via`` values, three connections opened once each. The
paths, nodes, and ownership remain visible after ``connect()``; a remotely
placed connection then uses its synthesized class name, such as
RemoteFrankaROSArm.

Once connected, observations and actions use the names from the composition:

.. code-block:: python

   robot.connect()
   try:
       arm = robot.child("arm", Arm)
       if not arm.is_robot_up():
           raise RuntimeError("The arm is not ready.")

       observation = robot.get_observation()
       base_pose = observation["base"]["pose"]
       arm_pose = observation["arm"]["tcp_pose"]

       # A partial action moves only the base.
       robot.send_action(
           {"base": {"velocity": np.array([0.1, 0.0], dtype=np.float32)}}
       )

       # A task may also command the base, arm, and hand together.
       robot.send_action(
           {
               "base": {"velocity": base_velocity},
               "arm": {"tcp_pose": arm_target},
               "end_effector": {"target": gripper_target},
           }
       )
   finally:
       robot.disconnect()

``child("arm", Arm)`` checks the expected category and gives setup code the
standard arm methods without reaching through the connection owner. The same
typed value works after remote placement. ``PartGroup.send_action`` accepts a
partial tree, so a navigation task need not send hold commands for the arm.
Here every branch has its own connection, so all three dispatch in parallel;
branches that shared one would run in declaration order.

3. Use the Robot in a Real-World Environment
--------------------------------------------

Hardware code says how to move the base. Task code decides where to move it,
when an episode succeeds, and which subset of the robot a policy controls. The
following ``RobotTask`` exposes only the base even though the robot also carries
an arm:

.. code-block:: python

   import gymnasium as gym

   from rlinf.envs.real.task_env import RobotTask, RobotTaskEnv


   class DriveToTarget(RobotTask):
       def __init__(self, target_xy: np.ndarray):
           self.target_xy = np.asarray(target_xy, dtype=np.float32)

       @property
       def description(self) -> str:
           return "drive the mobile manipulator to the target"

       @property
       def observation_space(self) -> gym.Space:
           return gym.spaces.Dict(
               {
                   "base": gym.spaces.Dict(
                       {
                           "pose": gym.spaces.Box(
                               -np.inf, np.inf, shape=(3,), dtype=np.float32
                           )
                       }
                   )
               }
           )

       @property
       def action_space(self) -> gym.Space:
           return gym.spaces.Dict(
               {
                   "base": gym.spaces.Dict(
                       {
                           "velocity": gym.spaces.Box(
                               low=np.array([-0.5, -1.0], dtype=np.float32),
                               high=np.array([0.5, 1.0], dtype=np.float32),
                           )
                       }
                   )
               }
           )

       @staticmethod
       def observe(robot: Robot) -> dict:
           return {"base": robot.get_observation()["base"]}

       def reset(self, robot: Robot, *, seed=None, options=None):
           del seed, options
           robot.reset()
           return self.observe(robot), {}

       def step(self, robot: Robot, action: dict):
           robot.send_action(action)
           observation = self.observe(robot)
           distance = float(
               np.linalg.norm(observation["base"]["pose"][:2] - self.target_xy)
           )
           reached = distance < 0.05
           return observation, float(reached), reached, False, {"distance": distance}


   env = RobotTaskEnv(robot, DriveToTarget(np.array([1.0, 0.0])))
   try:
       observation, info = env.reset()
       observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(
           {"base": {"velocity": np.array([0.1, 0.0], dtype=np.float32)}}
       )
   finally:
       env.close()

Read the task in the order the environment calls it. ``observation_space`` and
``action_space`` declare the policy boundary before an episode starts;
``observe()`` then selects the matching ``base`` branch from the larger robot
observation. ``reset()`` stops and resets the robot before returning the first
observation. On each step, ``step()`` sends the canonical action, reads the new
pose, and derives reward, termination, and diagnostic information from the same
state.

``RobotTaskEnv(robot, task)`` joins these task rules to the composed runtime. It
connects the robot during construction, forwards Gymnasium ``reset()`` and
``step()`` to the task, and disconnects in ``close()``. A manipulation task can
expand both spaces and the action dictionary with ``arm`` and
``end_effector``; the base driver and robot composition remain unchanged.

To launch the task through RLinf's distributed ``RealWorldEnv``, register the
environment with Gymnasium and set ``env_type: real`` plus its Gym ID in the env
YAML. The current rollout interface expects policy-facing ``state`` and
``frames`` observations, so add ``LegacyObservationAdapter`` and
``VectorActionAdapter`` when the policy uses that representation. Follow
:doc:`New Real-World Tasks <new_task>` for registration, YAML, wrappers, and
compatibility checks.

4. Place the Same Composition on Hardware Nodes
------------------------------------------------

Placement changes where each connection opens, not how tasks address it. For
example, keep the base controller on node 0 and the Franka controller on node 1:

.. code-block:: python

   base = ExampleMobileBase(
       "tcp://mobile-base:7000",
       node_rank=0,
       worker_name="ExampleMobileBase-0-0",
   )
   arm_parts = FrankaRobot.build_arms(
       robot_ip="10.0.0.2",
       node_rank=1,
       worker_rank=0,
       env_idx=0,
   )
   robot = MobileManipulator(
       base=base,
       **arm_parts,
   )

Constructing these objects records their hardware arguments and placement but
does not import either vendor SDK or open hardware. The connection layer handles
``node_rank`` and ``worker_name`` separately, so the driver's ``__init__`` only
declares hardware-specific parameters. ``robot.connect()`` opens each distinct
connection once on its declared node. A remote connection is rebuilt there and
the object in the robot becomes a forwarding view; the paths and calls remain
the same, so task code does not branch on placement.

If a later connection fails, the robot closes the connections that completed
before it. A driver must still clean up resources acquired inside a failing
``_open()`` call, because that connection never completed and cannot be rolled
back by the robot.

5. Build the Composition from Configuration
-------------------------------------------

Once the bench composition is correct, describe its hardware inputs with a
``RobotConfig`` dataclass and implement ``build()``. Reuse the existing arm
declaration rather than copying its SDK or lifecycle code:

.. code-block:: python

   from dataclasses import dataclass

   from rlinf.robotics import MobileBase, RobotConfig


   @dataclass
   class MobileManipulatorConfig(RobotConfig):
       base_backend: str = "example"
       base_endpoint: str | None = None
       arm_ip: str | None = None
       controller_node_rank: int | None = None


   class MobileManipulator(Robot):
       ROBOT_TYPE = "MobileManipulator"

       @classmethod
       def build(
           cls,
           *,
           base_backend: str = "example",
           base_endpoint: str | None,
           arm_ip: str | None,
           node_rank: int,
           controller_node_rank: int | None = None,
           worker_rank: int = 0,
           env_idx: int = 0,
       ) -> "MobileManipulator":
           if not base_endpoint:
               raise ValueError("MobileManipulator requires base_endpoint.")
           base_cls = MobileBase.backend(base_backend)
           base = base_cls(
               base_endpoint,
               node_rank=node_rank,
               worker_name=f"{base_cls.__name__}-{worker_rank}-{env_idx}",
           )
           arm_node_rank = (
               node_rank
               if controller_node_rank is None
               else controller_node_rank
           )
           arm_parts = FrankaRobot.build_arms(
               robot_ip=arm_ip,
               node_rank=arm_node_rank,
               worker_rank=worker_rank,
               env_idx=env_idx,
           )
           return cls(base=base, **arm_parts)

The config and builder describe different parts of the same construction.
``base_backend`` selects a registered mobile-base driver,
``base_endpoint`` and ``arm_ip`` identify the two devices, and
``controller_node_rank`` can place the arm away from the node that owns the
robot record. ``worker_rank`` and ``env_idx`` identify the environment instance
in generated worker names.

``build()`` consumes those values in the same order. It first resolves the base
class with ``MobileBase.backend()``, then declares the base with its placement.
Next it resolves the arm node, asks ``FrankaRobot.build_arms()`` for the
standard arm and end-effector declarations, and returns the three-part robot.
The result is still disconnected. Targets, rewards, reset poses, and episode
horizons remain in the task config because changing a task must not rebuild the
hardware abstraction.

Keep the signature explicit. ``Robot.of_type()`` and ``build_robot()`` forward
their keyword arguments directly to ``build()``; registration does not unpack a
``RobotConfig`` instance or discard fields the builder does not recognize. An
unexpected config key should therefore raise at this boundary instead of being
absorbed by ``**kwargs`` and silently ignored.

.. warning::

   Call ``connect()`` before reading observations or sending commands, and
   ``disconnect()`` during teardown. ``RobotTaskEnv`` performs both lifecycle
   operations when it owns the robot.

6. Register the Robot Type
--------------------------

The builder now creates the robot from explicit arguments. Registration gives
that composition a stable name for discovery and configuration. Most robots do
not need a discovery class of their own: register the robot and its config at
the end of the module, and ``register_type()`` creates the standard discovery
class and associates it with ``build()``:

.. code-block:: python

   MobileManipulator.register_type(MobileManipulatorConfig)

The standard discovery flow selects configs assigned to the current node,
fills unset fields from same-named uppercase environment variables, and returns
one hardware record per config. Camera fields, when present, use the shared
camera discovery and validation path. Pass a custom ``RobotDiscovery`` subclass
as the second argument only when the robot genuinely needs a different
enumeration procedure.

``Connection.register()`` and ``Robot.register_type()`` serve different
registries: the first names one device driver, while the second names the whole
robot composition. After the robot type is registered, callers can use either
``Robot.of_type("MobileManipulator", ...)`` or the convenience function
``build_robot("MobileManipulator", ...)``. Both calls still require the
builder's keyword arguments; registration does not turn a hardware config into
those arguments automatically.

For an in-tree implementation, place the module under
``rlinf/robotics/robots/`` and import it from that package's ``__init__.py``.
Importing ``rlinf.robotics.robots`` will then perform the registration before a
``Cluster`` or the bench checker looks up the type. An external integration
must import its registration module explicitly in its entry point instead.
Registered robot modules are also imported by node probes, so every node's
configured Python environment must be able to import the module.

7. Configure the Cluster
------------------------

Registration makes ``MobileManipulator`` resolvable; the cluster now supplies
one physical instance and its placement. Hardware entries live under
``cluster.node_groups.hardware``. Each entry is parsed with the registered
config class and becomes a ``RobotInfo`` during hardware discovery. Put
endpoints and node ranks in this YAML rather than embedding a deployment in
Python:

.. code-block:: yaml

   cluster:
     num_nodes: 2
     component_placement: {}
     node_groups:
       - label: mobile_manipulator
         node_ranks: 0
         hardware:
           type: MobileManipulator
           configs:
             - node_rank: 0
               base_backend: example
               base_endpoint: tcp://mobile-base:7000
               arm_ip: 10.0.0.2
               controller_node_rank: 1
       - label: arm_controller
         node_ranks: 1

The fields now follow the construction path above. ``type`` selects the
registered robot; each item in ``configs`` creates one hardware record.
``node_rank`` identifies the node that owns that record,
``base_backend`` and the two addresses identify its devices, and
``controller_node_rank`` places the reused Franka connection on its controller
node. The env config selects the Gym ID separately, so the same hardware
composition can serve navigation, mobile manipulation, or data-collection
tasks.

The environment receives that ``RobotInfo`` and calls the registered builder
explicitly. This is the visible boundary where scheduler metadata such as the
env worker rank is added:

.. code-block:: python

   hardware = robot_info.config
   robot = build_robot(
       "MobileManipulator",
       base_backend=hardware.base_backend,
       base_endpoint=hardware.base_endpoint,
       arm_ip=hardware.arm_ip,
       node_rank=hardware.node_rank,
       controller_node_rank=hardware.controller_node_rank,
       worker_rank=worker_info.rank,
       env_idx=env_idx,
   )

Keeping this call explicit prevents the hardware registry from becoming an
implicit adapter between unrelated config shapes. If several environments use
the same robot, place the translation in shared setup code rather than copying
it into each task.

8. Test the Integration
-----------------------

The implementation has crossed three boundaries: one device contract, a
composed robot, and remote placement. Validate them in the same order. Begin
with unit-level contracts and direct path assertions, continue with the real
classes against fake SDKs locally and remotely, and connect physical hardware
only after those checks pass.

For the contract layer, add a minimal fake for the example SDK under
``tests/robot_mocks/`` and include it in ``sdk_modules()``. The fake needs
only the device-side methods used above: ``get_pose()``, ``set_velocity()``,
``stop()``, and ``close()``. Registering it in one place makes the same fake
available to unit tests, the bench checker, and remote mock workers.

Then add a test under ``tests/unit_tests/`` beside the component you extended:
a new part or robot belongs in ``test_robotics.py``, and the environment that
drives it in ``test_real_env.py``. Cover the lifecycle the framework relies on
-- connect, reconnect, disconnect, and a disconnect that runs twice -- along
with the observation names and shapes the part declares, and a connect that
fails partway, which must leave no robot behind.

The rest of the integration is testable the same way. Cover the part contract,
composition paths, connection lifecycle, discovery registration, and the schema
policies expect:

.. code-block:: bash

   pytest tests/unit_tests/test_robotics.py tests/unit_tests/test_real_env.py

These exercise the scheduler import boundary, part composition, the task and
robot split, and the policy-facing schema of every built-in real-world
environment. None of it requires physical hardware.

Run It Against Faked SDKs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The contracts establish each public promise in isolation. The next check runs
the complete composition and, with ``--remote``, the process boundary. A part
imports its vendor SDK when it opens, never at import time, so a fake in
``sys.modules`` is enough to run the real part classes with nothing on the
other end of the cable. ``tests/robot_mocks`` holds one fake per SDK.

Walk your robot's composition against them:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m toolkits.realworld_check.check_robot_parts MobileManipulator --mock \
       --arg base_endpoint=tcp://mobile-base:7000 \
       --arg arm_ip=10.0.0.2 --arg node_rank=0 --arg controller_node_rank=0

It reports what the robot is made of, which connection backs each part and
where it was placed, then reads every part and disconnects. It fails when a
part observes something it never declared, when a value comes back a different
shape from the one declared, when a connection ends up in the tree, or when
anything still claims to be connected afterwards.

The shape check is particularly important: an env builds its observation space
from what a part declares, so a value one number wider reaches a policy as data
rather than as an error.

Add ``--remote`` to preserve the ``node_rank`` declarations while using the
mock SDKs. Connections that declare a node then run in scheduler workers;
connections without a ``node_rank`` still open in the current process. This is
what catches a part that cannot be placed at all -- for example, a method whose
name collides with the worker's own, or state that does not survive the process
boundary.

A whole training run works the same way. ``run.sh`` installs the fakes when the
config name contains ``mock``. Turtle2 is the closest shipped example of a
mobile manipulator and provides a working template for the new config:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash tests/e2e_tests/embodied/run.sh realworld_xsquare_turtle2_mock_sac_cnn

Every shipped robot has one, so the composition, the wrapper stack, the
observation space and the runner all run as they would on a bench:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 70

Run It Against the Robot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remaining checks require hardware: timing, calibration, and vendor behavior
not covered by the SDK documentation. Once the robot is powered and reachable,
drop ``--mock`` and run the same check against it:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m toolkits.realworld_check.check_robot_parts MobileManipulator \
       --arg base_endpoint=tcp://mobile-base:7000 \
       --arg arm_ip=10.0.0.2 --arg node_rank=0 --arg controller_node_rank=1

This run uses the installed vendor SDKs. It describes the composition before
connecting, opens each owner on its declared node, reads every part and compares
the result with its feature declaration, then disconnects and verifies that no
resource still reports itself open. It does not send an action, so test motion
limits and emergency-stop behavior separately under the platform's normal bench
procedure.
