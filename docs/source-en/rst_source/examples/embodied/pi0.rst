   The π\ :sub:`0`\  / π\ :sub:`0.5`\  flow-based VLA models.

Fine-tune the **π**\ :sub:`0`\  and **π**\ :sub:`0.5`\  flow-based VLA models with
reinforcement learning (PPO / GRPO) across several simulators using RLinf. For the full
method, see the paper
`πRL: Online RL Fine-Tuning for Flow-Based Vision-Language-Action Models <https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25889>`__.

Installation
------------

Use the NVIDIA setup below, or follow :ref:`the backend-specific setup <pi0-hardware>` for your hardware.

.. include:: _setup_common.rst

**Option 1: Docker image** — image tag ``agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero``:

.. code:: bash

   docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
      --shm-size 20g \
      --network host \
      --name rlinf \
      -v .:/workspace/RLinf \
      rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero
      # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
      # docker.1ms.run/rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-maniskill_libero

Please switch to the corresponding virtual environment via the built-in `switch_env` utility in the image:

.. code:: bash

   source switch_env openpi

**Option 2: Custom Environment**

Install dependencies directly in your environment by running the following command:

.. code:: bash

   # For mainland China users, you can add the `--use-mirror` flag to the install.sh command for better download speed.

   bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

--------------

Download the Model
------------------

Before starting training, you need to download the corresponding pretrained models. For example, for Spatial, Object, Goal task types in the LIBERO environment, you can download them as follows:

.. code:: bash

   # Download the Spatial-Object-Goal model (choose either method)
   # Method 1: Using git clone
   git lfs install
   git clone https://huggingface.co/RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-LIBERO-Spatial-Object-Goal-SFT

   # Method 2: Using huggingface-hub
   # For mainland China users, you can use the following for better download speed:
   # export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com
   pip install huggingface-hub
   hf download RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-LIBERO-Spatial-Object-Goal-SFT --local-dir RLinf-Pi0-LIBERO-Spatial-Object-Goal-SFT

Alternatively, you can download the model from ModelScope: https://www.modelscope.cn/models/RLinf/RLinf-Pi0-SFT-Spatial-Object-Goal.

Of course, RLinf also provides pretrained models for other environments. The model list is as follows:

After downloading, please make sure to specify the model path correctly in your configuration file.

Run It
------

**1. Key Cluster Configuration**

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-3
         rollout: 4-7
         actor: 0-7

   rollout:
      pipeline_stage_num: 2

Here you can flexibly configure the GPU count for env, rollout, and
actor components.
Additionally, by setting ``pipeline_stage_num = 2`` in the
configuration, you can achieve pipeline overlap between rollout and
env, improving rollout efficiency.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env,rollout,actor: all

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete sharing,
where env, rollout, and actor components all share all GPUs.

.. code:: yaml

   cluster:
      num_nodes: 1
      component_placement:
         env: 0-1
         rollout: 2-5
         actor: 6-7

You can also reconfigure the placement to achieve complete separation,
where env, rollout, and actor components each use their own GPUs without
interference, eliminating the need for offload functionality.

--------------

**2. Model Key Parameter Configuration**

**2.1 Model Parameters**

This page covers two implementations of π\ :sub:`0`\ / π\ :sub:`0.5`\ :
``model_type: openpi`` (templates ``model/pi0``, ``model/pi0_5``), which the
recipes above use, and ``model_type: openpi_rlinf`` (templates
``model/pi0_rlinf``, ``model/pi0_5_rlinf``). Both keep the network action
horizon separate from the chunk the environment executes:

- ``num_action_chunks`` / ``openpi.action_chunk`` is the **env-executed**
  chunk (what RLinf sends to the simulator).
- The **network** ``action_horizon`` is ``openpi.action_horizon`` when set;
  otherwise the official OpenPI ``TrainConfig.model.action_horizon`` for
  ``openpi.config_name``; otherwise it falls back to ``num_action_chunks``.

The ``openpi`` implementation copies ``action_horizon`` from official
``TrainConfig.model``, then overlays ``cfg.openpi``. Default templates only
interpolate ``num_action_chunks`` into ``action_chunk``; they do **not** set
the network horizon from ``num_action_chunks``.

LIBERO PPO commonly sets ``num_action_chunks: 5`` while ``pi0_libero`` still
uses official horizon **50** and ``pi05_libero`` uses official horizon **10**.
Override ``openpi.action_horizon`` in the experiment YAML only when the
checkpoint horizon differs from that ``TrainConfig``.

The following is an ``openpi_rlinf`` example. Launch it with
``bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_rlinf``.

.. code:: yaml

   actor:
     model:
       pi05: False                 # True for π0.5; lives on actor.model, not under openpi
       num_action_chunks: 5        # env interface, not the network horizon
       openpi:
         task: rl                  # sft | eval | rl | dagger | dsrl
         config_name: "pi0_libero" # official TrainConfig (network action_horizon)
         noise_level: 0.5 # default noise intensity for flow_sde
         noise_logvar_range: [0.08, 0.16] # default learnable noise range for flow_noise
         action_chunk: ${..num_action_chunks}
         num_steps: ${..num_steps}
         train_expert_only: True
         action_env_dim: ${..action_dim}
         noise_method: "flow_sde" # flow_sde, flow_noise
         add_value_head: ${..add_value_head}
         value_after_vlm: False

- Set different flow-matching steps via ``num_steps``.

- Use different noise injection methods by modifying ``noise_method``. We provide two options:
  `flow_sde <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05470>`__ and
  `flow_noise <https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094>`__.
  ``noise_level`` controls the noise intensity for ``flow_sde``, and ``noise_logvar_range`` controls the learnable noise range for ``flow_noise``.

- Select π\ :sub:`0.5`\  through ``openpi.config_name`` (e.g. ``pi05_libero``).
  With ``openpi_rlinf``, also set ``actor.model.pi05: True``; it defaults to
  True when omitted, and ``model/pi0_rlinf`` sets it to False.

- Control the critic position via ``value_after_vlm``: when True, the critic is connected after the VLM module output; when False, the critic input is from the action expert module output. π\ :sub:`0.5`\  PPO should set ``value_after_vlm: True``.

**2.2 Algorithm Configuration**

In the paper, we provide two technical approaches, flow-noise and flow-sde, to fine-tune π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  models. Specifically, you can choose different technical approaches by switching the following configuration:

.. code:: yaml

   algorithm:
      entropy_bonus: 0.0 # entropy regularization coefficient, set to 0.0 for flow-sde, 0.005 for flow-noise
   openpi:
     noise_method: "flow_sde" # [flow_sde,flow_noise] noise injection method, flow-sde introduces noise through ode-sde transformation, flow-noise introduces noise through noise network
     noise_level: 0.5 # noise intensity for flow-sde
     noise_logvar_range: [0.08, 0.16] # learnable noise range for flow-noise
     joint_logprob: False # whether to optimize joint probability density function. For flow-sde, please set to False. For flow-noise, please set to True.

For a complete flow-sde setup on ``openpi_rlinf``, see
``libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_rlinf.yaml``. The legacy ``openpi`` recipes are
``libero_spatial_ppo_openpi.yaml`` (flow-sde) and
``maniskill_ppo_openpi.yaml`` (flow-noise).

**2.3 LoRA Settings**

.. code:: yaml

   model:
     is_lora: True
     lora_rank: 8
     gradient_checkpointing: False

If you want to use LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to fine-tune the VLM part, please set ``is_lora: True`` and configure the ``lora_rank`` parameter. Note that gradient checkpointing is currently **not supported**, please keep ``gradient_checkpointing: False``.

⭐ **2.4 Minimum Test Case** ⭐

If you encounter OOM errors or want to implement a minimum test case with as few resources as possible, you can refer to ``libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_quickstart.yaml``.
Compared to the standard task configuration, we have made the following modifications:

.. code:: yaml

   env.train.rollout_epoch: 8 -> 2
   env.train.total_num_envs: 64 -> 32
   actor.micro_batch_size: 128 -> 64
   actor.global_batch_size: 2048 -> 256
   actor.optim.lr: 5e-6 -> 1e-6
   actor.enable_offload: False -> True
   rollout.enable_offload: False -> True

On 4 H100 GPUs, we compared the results of standard parameters and minimum test parameters, and found that their performance is almost the same at the same time: (minimum test parameters optimize faster per round, but converge slower)

.. image:: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d098f6-5286-4ff4-89be-547f43a4dc86
   :alt: Minimum test case comparison
   :width: 95%
   :align: center

If you still encounter OOM issues under the minimum parameter configuration, we provide the following solutions:

**If OOM occurs during the rollout stage:**

- Try replacing the rendering engine from ``egl`` to ``osmesa``
- Further reduce ``env.train.total_num_envs`` from 32 to 16, but increase ``env.train.rollout_epoch`` from 2 to 4 to ensure the total number of environments per rollout round remains consistent
- Check if actor's ``enable_offload`` is enabled, and set it to ``True`` if it is ``False``

**If OOM occurs during the actor stage:**

- Try reducing ``micro_batch_size`` from 64 to 32, keeping ``global_batch_size`` at 256
- Check if rollout's ``enable_offload`` is enabled, and set it to ``True`` if it is ``False``

.. note::

   If you encounter a mismatch between ``micro_batch_size`` and ``global_batch_size``, ensure that ``global_batch_size`` is an integer multiple of ``micro_batch_size`` × number of GPUs.

**2.5 Model Evaluation**

For models after SFT or RL training, we provide two evaluation methods:

- Use RLinf's unified evaluation script; see :doc:`evaluation <../../evaluations/index>` for evaluation. This method supports parallel environment evaluation, which is fast, but only supports outputting the success rate of the entire task.
- To hide inference latency during evaluation or deployment, π\ :sub:`0.5`\  is also integrated with RTC, which overlaps action-chunk execution with the next chunk's inference; see :doc:`RTC <../../guides/rtc>`.

.. note::

   ``Metaworld`` currently do not support the evaluation mode with ``env.eval.auto_reset=True``. It is recommended to use individual script files for model evaluation.

- Use individual script files for model evaluation, refer to the example `README.md <https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf/blob/main/toolkits/standalone_eval_scripts/openpi/README.md>`__. This method's evaluation scripts are consistent with the official evaluation scripts provided by ``openpi``, supporting output of success rates for each subtask, but it is slower.

**3. Configuration Files**

Using libero-10 as an example, the configuration files for π\ :sub:`0`\  and π\ :sub:`0.5`\  are:

- π\ :sub:`0`\ + PPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openpi.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0`\ + GRPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_grpo_openpi.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0.5`\ + PPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openpi_pi05.yaml``
- π\ :sub:`0.5`\ + GRPO:
   ``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_grpo_openpi_pi05.yaml``

--------------

**4. Launch Command**

To start training with a chosen configuration, run the following
command:

::

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh CHOSEN_CONFIG

For example, to train the π\ :sub:`0`\  model using the PPO algorithm in
the LIBERO environment, run:

::

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh libero_spatial_ppo_openpi_quickstart

Run on Different Hardware Backends
----------------------------------

NVIDIA uses the installation and launch steps above. AMD ROCm, Huawei Ascend
CANN, and Moore Threads MUSA support the OpenPI π₀ / π₀.₅ model family on
LIBERO and ManiSkill through the shared platform installer and scheduler device
API. ManiSkill uses CPU simulation on the non-CUDA backends; MUSA additionally
requires vendor simulator packages.

AMD ROCm
~~~~~~~~

ROCm uses PyTorch's CUDA-compatible API, so OpenPI follows the shared AMD
accelerator and installation path.

.. include:: _amd_libero.rst

Inside the container, or directly on a host with ROCm installed, create the
OpenPI LIBERO environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash requirements/install.sh --platform amd --rocm 6.4 embodied --model openpi --env libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Omit ``--rocm`` to detect the installed version, or add ``--use-mirror`` for
downloads from mainland China.

Huawei Ascend CANN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the Ascend LIBERO container or a host with CANN and the NPU driver installed.

.. include:: _ascend_libero.rst

The published LIBERO image does not contain an OpenPI environment. Create one
inside that container, or run the same command directly on an Ascend host:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash requirements/install.sh --platform ascend embodied --model openpi --env libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Add ``--use-mirror`` for downloads from mainland China. The installer adds the
matching ``torch-npu`` package and skips CUDA flash-attention; OpenPI then uses
the common NPU worker and collective paths.

Moore Threads MUSA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MUSA reuses the image's Python, PyTorch, and ``torch_musa`` through a virtual
environment with system site-packages enabled. The installer preserves those
vendor packages and skips CUDA-only dependencies.

.. include:: _musa_libero.rst

Inside the container, create the OpenPI LIBERO environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash requirements/install.sh --platform musa embodied --model openpi --env libero
   source .venv/bin/activate

Add ``--use-mirror`` for downloads from mainland China. If a Transformers model
path requests ``attn_implementation: flash_attention_2`` but Transformers cannot
detect the vendor package, select ``sdpa`` instead.

LIBERO on AMD, Ascend, or MUSA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choose a LIBERO checkpoint and matching config from the model list above. The
following commands use the π₀.₅ LIBERO-10 PPO path as a concrete example. Set
both model paths in
``examples/embodiment/config/libero_10_ppo_openpi_pi05.yaml`` and enable
software rendering in the active environment.

.. include:: _libero_osmesa.rst

Launch the LIBERO PPO recipe:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh libero_10_ppo_openpi_pi05

ManiSkill on AMD, Ascend, or MUSA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On AMD or Ascend, install the combined ManiSkill and LIBERO environment for
OpenPI. Use the command for the selected model accelerator:

.. code-block:: bash

   # AMD ROCm
   bash requirements/install.sh --platform amd --rocm 6.4 embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero

   # Huawei Ascend CANN
   bash requirements/install.sh --platform ascend embodied --model openpi --env maniskill_libero

   source .venv/bin/activate

For MUSA, use the vendor simulator image and its existing OpenPI environment:

.. include:: _musa_maniskill.rst

.. code-block:: bash

   source switch_env openpi

Configure CPU simulation for all three non-CUDA backends:

.. include:: _maniskill_non_cuda.rst

For π₀.₅, download ``RLinf/RLinf-Pi05-ManiSkill-25Main-SFT`` and set both model
paths in ``examples/embodiment/config/maniskill_ppo_openpi_pi05.yaml``. The π₀
recipe uses ``maniskill_ppo_openpi.yaml`` instead. Adjust placement and batch
sizes for the available devices, then launch the selected recipe; for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh maniskill_ppo_openpi_pi05
