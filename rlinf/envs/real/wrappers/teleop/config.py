"""Resolve teleoperation devices from an environment configuration.

``teleop`` accepts a device name or an ordered list of devices with options::

    teleop:
      - {gello_joint: {port: /dev/left,  drives: left}}
      - {gello_joint: {port: /dev/right, drives: right}}

Legacy keys still select one device and emit a deprecation warning. Device
compatibility is validated before the environment opens hardware.
