"""Genesis task registry.

Tasks define the scene layout (robot, objects, cameras), reset logic,
reward computation, and observation extraction for a specific manipulation
or locomotion scenario running inside the Genesis simulator.

To register a new task, add it to ``_TASK_REGISTRY`` below and implement
the :class:`GenesisTaskBase` interface.
