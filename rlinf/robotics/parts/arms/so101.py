"""SO-101 follower arm, driven through lerobot's ``SO101Follower``.

The SO-101 is a 5-DOF arm with a parallel gripper, all six joints driven by
Feetech STS3215 serial servos on one bus. lerobot owns the servo protocol and
the calibration file; this module adapts it to the arm contract.

Two things differ from the lerobot API and are converted here:

* lerobot reports and accepts joint values in degrees, and the gripper on its
  own ``0..100`` scale. Every other RLinf arm reports ``arm_joint_position`` in
  radians, so joints are converted on the way out and back on the way in, and
  the gripper is carried as a fraction in ``0..1``.
* lerobot names each value ``"<motor>.pos"``; the canonical observation is one
  vector ordered by :pyattr:`SO101Arm.MOTORS`.
