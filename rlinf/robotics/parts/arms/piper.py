"""AgileX Piper arm, driven through ``pyAgxArm`` over a CAN bus.

Registered as ``pyagxarm``, after the SDK, so a driver for the same arm over
another SDK registers beside it. The AgxGripper shares the bus and is exported
beneath the arm.

``pyAgxArm`` already works in radians, metres, and newtons. Note that its
``disable()`` and ``reset()`` both cut motor power, dropping a raised arm, so
neither is used here.
