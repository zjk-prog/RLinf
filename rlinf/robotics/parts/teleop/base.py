"""One operator input device: what it reads, and how that drives a robot.

A device answers three questions, and a new one is written by answering them
in a single class::

    @TeleopDevice.register("so101_leader")
    class SO101Leader(TeleopDevice):
        PRODUCES = {"arm": ActionKind.JOINT_POSITION}
        NEEDS = ("joint_positions",)

        def _open(self): ...  # reach the hardware
        def get_observation(self): ...  # what the operator is doing
        def action(self, reading, context): ...  # what the robot should do

Config becomes constructor arguments through :meth:`TeleopDevice.from_config`,
which by default passes the device's options straight through, so a device
whose config names match its arguments writes none of that itself.
