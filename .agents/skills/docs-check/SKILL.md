# Docs Check

## Quick Start

Use this skill when documentation changes may introduce mismatches with:

- Code and config source of truth
- Other existing docs in the same section
- English and corresponding Chinese docs

Always read `reference.md` first, then run the workflow below.

Two harnesses in this folder do the mechanical part; run them before reasoning
about content:

```bash
# Does the page still build? Both Read the Docs projects use fail_on_warning.
python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/build_docs.py            # en + zh

# Does CJK punctuation break inline markup, loudly or silently?
python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_rst_markup.py      # needs docutils

# Does the page still name things the code has?
python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_doc_symbols.py
```

## Inputs

Collect these inputs before reviewing:

- Changed doc files (or target docs to validate)
- Corresponding EN and ZH files for the same topic
- Related code/config files referenced by the docs

If scope is unclear, default to checking:

- `docs/source-en/` and `docs/source-zh/` counterparts
- `rlinf/config.py` (`SupportedModel`)
- `rlinf/envs/__init__.py` (`SupportedEnvType`)
- Referenced scripts under `examples/`, `toolkits/`, `ray_utils/`, and `requirements/`

## Workflow

1. Read `reference.md` and extract the relevant checklist items.
2. Run the build harness for **both** languages and fix every warning:
   - `python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/build_docs.py` (add `--lang zh` to
     iterate faster on a Chinese-only failure).
   - The two Read the Docs projects build independently with
     `fail_on_warning: true`, so an English-clean page can still turn
     `docs/readthedocs.org:rlinf-cn` red. Never conclude "docs are fine"
     from one language.
   - Then `python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_rst_markup.py` for the
     inline-markup defects that render wrong *without* warning.
3. Verify doc-to-code correctness:
   - Commands exist and are runnable in principle.
   - Script/module paths in docs exist.
   - Config keys and values match real code/config names.
   - Model/env names match `SupportedModel` and `SupportedEnvType` string values.
4. Verify doc-to-doc consistency within one language:
   - Terminology is consistent across start/tutorials/examples/API pages.
   - New page is linked in the correct index/toctree.
   - No conflicting instructions between related pages.
   - Internal doc links use stable `:doc:`/relative links, not hardcoded ReadTheDocs URLs.
5. Verify EN-ZH parity:
   - Same topic coverage and section structure.
   - Same commands, config keys, and model/env identifiers.
   - Translations preserve technical meaning (do not rename code symbols).
   - Corresponding EN/ZH pages use equivalent stable internal links.
6. Verify natural-language flow:
   - Treat continuity as a requirement for every article, including landing,
     recipe, reference, and non-code prose pages. Adapt the depth of the lead to
     the page type, but do not exempt a page from establishing its purpose and
     order.
   - The first prose sentence after the title, or after a leading figure, states
     directly what the page explains, enables, routes, or lets the reader look
     up. Background must not delay the page's purpose until a later paragraph.
   - The page introduction establishes the reader's starting situation, the
     promised result, the topic boundary, and the order of the explanation.
   - Read the introduction followed only by each section's opening paragraph.
     They must form a coherent outline in which every section follows from the
     state established before it.
   - Each section opens by stating the question it resolves and its connection
     to the surrounding workflow; it does not begin abruptly with code, a table,
     an API identifier, or a fact unrelated to the previous section.
   - Paragraphs develop one argument in dependency order rather than forming a
     reorderable list of correct facts.
   - Every public operation in the primary example is explained in caller order,
     including the relevant input or return value and lifecycle effect. Each
     non-trivial code block has a stated purpose and an interpretation.
   - Start from a concrete reader question, explain the idea in ordinary
     language, then introduce the exact API term and example.
   - Headings, cards, and opening sentences do not introduce unexplained
     implementation terms. An identifier heading is appropriate only on a
     lookup-oriented API or reference page, or after the term is established.
   - English reads as direct colleague-to-colleague prose, without canned
     transitions, uniform paragraph rhythms, or promotional summaries.
   - Chinese follows natural Chinese logic rather than English clause order.
     Familiar developer terms stay in English when translating them would sound
     unusual or make the code harder to search.
   - Chinese uses restrained written technical language: neither casual chat nor
     bureaucratic prose.
   - Chinese prose paragraphs and prose list items stay on one source line.
     A hard wrap inside prose renders as a visible space between Chinese
     characters even when the source contains no typed space.
7. Report findings with severity and concrete fixes.

## Severity Rules

- `Critical`: A Sphinx warning in either language — Read the Docs fails the
  build, so the page does not ship at all.
- `Critical`: Wrong command/path/key/value that can break user workflow.
- `Major`: Inconsistent docs that likely mislead users.
- `Major`: An unexplained implementation term in a heading or opening breaks the
  reading flow on a concept, guide, or extending page.
- `Major`: A page or section lacks a lead, sections do not form a logical
  progression, or the primary example uses public operations that the prose
  never explains.
- `Minor`: Wording/terminology drift without immediate breakage.
- `Minor`: Formulaic or translated prose is understandable but does not read
  naturally in its language.

Prefer actionable findings with exact file paths and corrected values.

Hardcoded ReadTheDocs links to RLinf docs should be reported as at least `Major`.

## Output Format

Use this format when reporting results:

```markdown
## Docs Check Findings

- Critical: <issue>, in `<path>`
  - Why: <impact>
  - Fix: <specific correction>

- Major: <issue>, in `<path>`
  - Why: <impact>
  - Fix: <specific correction>

- Minor: <issue>, in `<path>`
  - Why: <impact>
  - Fix: <specific correction>

## Verified

- <what was checked and confirmed>
```

If no issues are found, explicitly state:

`No doc-code or EN-ZH consistency issues found in checked scope.`

## Guardrails

- Do not invent model/env/config names; verify against source files.
- Do not change code to match incorrect docs unless explicitly requested.
- Keep EN and ZH technical tokens identical where applicable (paths, CLI flags, keys, enum values).
- Do not force-translate familiar terms such as `policy`, `key`, `value`,
  `mapping`, `endpoint`, `worker`, `binding`, `wrapper`, `mock SDK`, `contract`,
  `shape`, `schema`, and `API`; explain their role in natural Chinese and retain
  the searchable term when that is normal developer usage. In RL prose, keep
  `policy` in English rather than translating it as “策略”; generic strategies,
  such as a placement strategy, may still use “策略”.
- When uncertain, flag as an assumption and request confirmation.
- Do not keep RLinf internal links as hardcoded `readthedocs.io/.../rst_source/...` URLs; convert to `:doc:` or relative internal links.

## Quick Detection

Use this regex scan to detect unstable hardcoded RLinf docs links:

- `readthedocs\.io/(en|zh-cn)/latest/rst_source/`

Chinese pages: `` `` `` or `**` sitting directly against `（`, `《` or a CJK
character is the single most common way to break `rlinf-cn`. Grep for
```` ``（ ```` and ```` **（ ```` as a first pass, then run
`check_rst_markup.py` for the full rule.
