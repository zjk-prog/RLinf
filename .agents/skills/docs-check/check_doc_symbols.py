"""Check that every name the docs put in code font exists in the code.

The build checks that a page renders and the link checker checks that a
``:doc:`` target resolves.  Neither reads what the page *says*.  A page can
describe a class that was renamed three commits ago, show a table whose shape
changed, or name a config key nobody reads, and every existing gate passes.

That is not hypothetical: ``concepts/realworld_envs.rst`` documented ``TASKS``
as a mapping of gym id to ``(env class, wrapper builder)`` for several commits
after the wrapper builder was deleted, and the docs build stayed clean.

So this reads every ``literal`` on every page and asks whether that name occurs
anywhere in the repository.  A name that does not is either renamed, deleted, or
a typo.  It is deliberately a spell-check rather than a resolver: it does not
know whether ``FrankaEnv.step`` still takes what the page claims, only that
nothing called ``FrankaEnv`` exists any more.  That catches the drift that
matters and costs one pass over the tree.

Prose in double backticks is reported too, because prose does not belong in
code font.  Genuinely illustrative names -- the ``ExampleArm`` of a tutorial --
go in ``ALLOWED`` below or in a ``--allow`` argument.

Usage::

    python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_doc_symbols.py           # all docs
    python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_doc_symbols.py FILE...   # subset
    python3 .agents/skills/docs-check/check_doc_symbols.py --allow Foo --allow Bar

Exit code is 1 when any unknown name is reported, 0 otherwise.
