# Refine RLinf Docs

Bring a documentation page (or a whole section) up to the RLinf documentation
**style guide**. Use this when writing a new page, rewriting an existing one, or
doing a style/structure pass.

The single source of truth is **`docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`** — read it first and apply
it. This skill is the operating procedure; the style guide holds the exact rules.
When the two disagree, the style guide wins.

## When to use

- Editing/improving an existing page, or drafting a new one.
- A "make this page match our docs style" / "clean up these docs" request.
- Pair with the **docs-check** skill: `refine-docs` covers voice, structure, and
  style; `docs-check` covers facts, code references, and EN/ZH parity.

## Workflow

1. **Read `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md`.** It is authoritative.
2. **Find both language files.** Every page exists at `docs/source-en/...` and
   `docs/source-zh/...`. Refine **both in the same pass** and keep them in parity.
3. **Classify the page**, then apply the matching part of the guide:
   - **Landing / section / sub-section index** → cards or tables + a `:hidden:`
     toctree; one-line outcome; routed list. Never body bullet lists.
   - **Recipe / example page** (env, model, algorithm, SFT, robot) → the page
     anatomy: figure + intro → `Overview` (4 aligned cards) → `Tasks` +
     `Observation and Action` tables → `Installation` → `Download the Model` →
     `Run It` → `Visualization and Results`. Use the standard section names and
     the aligned card schema for that gallery subsection.
   - **Concept / guide / reference / extending prose page** → outcome-first intro,
     short sections, link out instead of inlining reference material.
4. **Inspect the implementation behind the page.** Verify public signatures,
   accepted input types, concrete return types, lifecycle behavior, config names,
   and representative call sites. When two related types are accepted by one
   API, explain what each represents and why both forms are valid. Pair this pass
   with **docs-check** for broader doc-to-code validation.
5. **Plan the page as one continuous article.** This is a basic requirement for
   every page type, not only Concepts, Guides, or code documentation. Write down the reader's
   starting state, the result promised by the page, and one sentence explaining
   why each section follows the previous one. Lead with the normal local
   workflow, then the common extension, composition with existing components,
   remote or distributed use, and finally ownership or scheduler internals. Use
   only the stages that fit the topic, but do not use the internal class hierarchy
   as the teaching outline.
   - Start the first prose sentence by stating directly what the page explains,
     enables, routes, or lets the reader look up. A leading figure may come
     first, but background prose may not postpone the page's purpose.
   - Give the rest of the page introduction a result, scope, and roadmap.
   - Give each section an opening paragraph that connects it to the established
     state and identifies the question it resolves; do not merely restate the
     heading.
   - Within a section, order paragraphs as distinction → API → example →
     interpretation → consequence or transition.
   - For an interface workflow, list every public call used by the primary
     example and explain it in caller order, including important inputs, return
     values, lifecycle effects, and how one result feeds the next call.
6. **Apply the voice rules** to every paragraph: second person, imperative,
   outcome first, no throat-clearing, short sentences, annotate non-trivial
   commands ("What this does: 1… 2…").
   - Explain before naming: concrete situation → ordinary-language distinction →
     exact API term → example → edge cases.
   - A heading must be understandable before its section is read. Do not put an
     unexplained implementation term in a heading and define it below.
7. **Make examples demonstrate use, not only syntax.** Introduce the outcome of
   each non-trivial code block before it and interpret the relevant result or
   lifecycle effect afterwards. For an extensible
   abstraction, show how the new component composes with an existing one, how a
   caller reads or controls it, and how it participates in the relevant task or
   environment.
8. **Fix structure and labels:** Title Case headings + standard names, one H1 per
   page, bare nav captions, cards/tables instead of bullet walls, footguns in a
   `warning`, correct axis ownership/placement.
9. **De-duplicate:** link to the canonical Reference / Evaluation page instead of
   re-explaining; if identical prose/commands repeat across 3+ pages, extract an
   underscore include partial (`_name.rst`).
10. **Keep EN ↔ ZH parity:** same structure and (translated) headings; identical,
   untranslated code identifiers (config keys, CLI flags, env/model names); stable
   `:doc:` / `:ref:` links (no hardcoded ReadTheDocs URLs); never glue `**bold**`
   directly between CJK characters.
   Write each language natively: preserve meaning and structure, not English
   clause order. Keep familiar developer terms in English when a Chinese
   translation would sound unusual or make the code harder to search.
   Keep each Chinese prose paragraph or prose list item on one source line.
   reStructuredText renders a hard wrap inside prose as a visible space, which
   leaves an unnatural gap between Chinese characters. Keep structural line
   breaks in headings, directives, tables, and code blocks.
11. **Verify (the gate)** — see below.

## Natural-language gate

- **English:** write like one engineer explaining the system to another. Use
  concrete nouns and verbs, vary paragraph shape, and remove canned transitions,
  promotional summaries, and sentences that merely announce the next section.
- **Chinese:** reorganize the explanation around natural Chinese logic instead
  of translating sentence by sentence. Keep common terms such as `policy`, `key`,
  `value`, `mapping`, `endpoint`, `worker`, `binding`, `wrapper`, `mock SDK`,
  `contract`, `shape`, `schema`, and `API` in English when that is how developers
  use them. In RL prose, write `policy`, not the literal translation “策略”;
  “策略” may still describe a generic strategy such as a placement strategy.
  Use restrained written technical language. Natural Chinese should not sound
  like casual developer chat (`看看长什么样`, `等需要时再看`, `不用跟着改`),
  but it should also avoid bureaucratic phrasing such as `本文旨在` and
  `进行相关操作`.
- **Both:** introduce a concept before using its code name as shorthand. API and
  reference pages may use an identifier as a heading when readers are looking up
  that identifier; concept, guide, and extending pages must establish it first.

## Quick checklists by page type

**Any page**
- [ ] The first prose sentence states directly what the page does; it does not
      make the reader infer the purpose from background.
- [ ] Opens with the outcome, second person, no throat-clearing.
- [ ] The introduction establishes the reader's situation, scope, result, and
      the order in which the page reaches it.
- [ ] Reading only the introduction and each section's opening paragraph yields
      a coherent outline; every section states why it belongs at that point.
- [ ] Paragraphs within a section form a dependency chain rather than a
      reorderable list of facts.
- [ ] Every public operation used by the primary example is explained in caller
      order, with relevant inputs, return values, and lifecycle effects.
- [ ] Every non-trivial code block is framed by its purpose and interpretation.
- [ ] New terms are explained before they appear in headings, cards, or tables.
- [ ] Public types, return values, lifecycle statements, and config names match
      the implementation and representative call sites.
- [ ] The normal workflow precedes composition, remote operation, and internals.
- [ ] Extension examples compose with existing components and reach a real caller,
      task, or environment.
- [ ] One H1; Title Case headings; standard section names where applicable.
- [ ] EN and ZH updated together; code tokens identical; no CJK-glued `**bold**`.
- [ ] ZH preserves meaning without mirroring EN sentence by sentence.
- [ ] ZH prose is not hard-wrapped inside a paragraph or list item.
- [ ] Reference material linked, not inlined; repeated blocks factored into partials.

**Index / landing page**
- [ ] Body uses a card grid or `list-table`, not bullets or bare `:doc:` lists.
- [ ] `.. toctree::` is `:hidden:` and drives nav/order.
- [ ] One-line purpose ("Pick this when…") before the cards/tables.

**Recipe / example page**
- [ ] Credited figure + one-paragraph intro.
- [ ] `Overview` card grid (`.. grid:: 2 4 4 4`) with the gallery's aligned schema.
- [ ] `Tasks` and `Observation and Action` are `list-table`s.
- [ ] No "Env type" card, no generic "Algorithm" section, no boilerplate VLA intro.
- [ ] Metrics/eval linked out; only "watch `env/success_once`" + a results table stay.
- [ ] Shared install / model-path tails come from `_setup_common.rst` / `_model_path.rst`.

## Gate

- Build both trees with **zero new warnings**:
  `/opt/venv/docs/bin/sphinx-build -b html docs/source-en /tmp/build-en` and the
  same for `docs/source-zh`.
- Run the **`docs-check`** skill (doc-to-code correctness + EN/ZH parity).
- Confirm: no new bullet-list index pages, no throat-clearing intros, and no
  literal `**` leaking into built ZH pages from CJK-glued bold.
- For every article, read the introduction followed only by section leads, then
  read the complete page. Reject the page if the short pass does not form a
  logical outline. Apply the same rule compactly to indexes and references: the
  lead must establish what the page routes or lets readers look up, and the
  cards, tables, or entries must follow a deliberate order. When a page teaches
  an interface, reject it if the full pass leaves primary-example API calls
  unexplained.
