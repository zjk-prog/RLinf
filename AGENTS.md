# AGENTS.md

Brief for AI coding agents working on RLinf. For full contribution flow, code style, and PR process see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

**Quick orientation:** RLinf is a distributed RL stack (embodied + reasoning + agent). It uses **Ray** for process management and **Hydra** for config. Single-machine runs use `cluster.num_nodes: 1`; multi-node needs Ray started on every node with `RLINF_NODE_RANK` set *before* `ray start`. Pre-commit runs Ruff (lint + format) and commit-check; use Google-style docstrings and type hints. All user-facing changes need tests and docs. If something is unclear, add a `TODO(agent)` and note the limitation.

## How RLinf runs

You launch one entry script (e.g. `train_embodied_agent.py`, `train_async.py`). It builds a **Cluster** (Ray must already be up), figures **component placement** (actor, rollout, env, reward, agent), and starts **Worker** groups. A **Runner** drives the loop: rollout → reward → advantage → actor update (and any inference/engine lifecycle). Cluster config lives in YAML under `cluster:`: `num_nodes`, `component_placement`, `node_groups` (labels, node_ranks, env_configs, optional hardware e.g. Franka). Placement (e.g. `HybridComponentPlacement`, `ModelParallelComponentPlacement`) maps components to node groups and hardware ranks. Workers are Ray remote actors with `MASTER_*`, `RANK`, etc.; they can `send`/`recv` across groups. Training backends: FSDP or Megatron. Rollout: SGLang or vLLM. Runners pick loss/advantage from config (PPO, GRPO, SAC, etc.).

---

## Single-node and multi-node

**Single machine:** Install via Docker or `bash requirements/install.sh embodied --model <model> --env <env>` (set `REPO_PATH` and any asset paths). Ray may auto-start; or run `ray start --head`. Use a config with `cluster.num_nodes: 1` (e.g. from `examples/embodiment/config/`). Launch with `bash examples/embodiment/run_embodiment.sh <config_name>` or `python examples/embodiment/train_embodied_agent.py --config-name <config_name>`, and set env vars the example needs (e.g. `MUJOCO_GL=egl`, `ROBOT_PLATFORM`).

**Multiple machines:** On each node, *before* `ray start`: set `export RLINF_NODE_RANK=<0..N-1>` (unique) and optionally `RLINF_COMM_NET_DEVICES`. Head: `ray start --head --port=6379 --node-ip-address=<head_ip>`. Workers: `ray start --address=<head_ip>:6379`. You can use `ray_utils/start_ray.sh`. Set `cluster.num_nodes` to the total; optionally use `node_groups` and `component_placement` (see `rlinf/scheduler/cluster/config.py` and the [heterogeneous cluster tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/guides/hetero.html)). Run the entry script *only on the head*; it attaches to the existing Ray cluster and schedules workers by placement.

---

## Configuration guides

- **Placement and throughput:** Configure `cluster.component_placement` (collocated vs disaggregated vs hybrid, node groups, hardware ranks). See [placement tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/concepts/placement.html) and [execution modes](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/concepts/execution_modes.html).
- **OOM:** Tune env (`total_num_envs`, `group_size`), rollout (batch/seq, `gpu_memory_utilization`, `enable_offload`), actor (`micro_batch_size`, `global_batch_size`, `gradient_checkpointing`, `enable_offload`). Example configs in `examples/embodiment/config/`. See [FAQ](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/resources/faq.html) for SGLang/memory issues.
- **Multi-node and hetero:** Set `cluster.num_nodes`; set `RLINF_NODE_RANK` (and optionally `RLINF_COMM_NET_DEVICES`) **before** `ray start` on each node—Ray captures env at start time. Optional `node_groups` and `component_placement` in YAML; `env_configs` (e.g. `env_vars`, `python_interpreter_path`) are applied at worker allocation. See [heterogeneous cluster](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/guides/hetero.html) and `rlinf/scheduler/cluster/config.py`.

---

## Metrics, checkpoints, and evaluation

- **Metrics:** Runners use `MetricLogger`; set `runner.logger.logger_backends` (e.g. tensorboard, wandb, swanlab). Namespaces include `train/`, `eval/`, `env/`, `rollout/`, `time/`. See [logger tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/guides/logger.html).
- **Checkpoints:** Saved every `runner.save_interval` under `.../checkpoints/global_step_<N>/`. To resume, set `runner.resume_dir` to that path and relaunch; some runners support `resume_dir: auto`. See [checkpoint resume tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/guides/resume.html).
- **Evaluation:** During training, `runner.val_check_interval` triggers validation. Standalone embodied: `bash evaluations/run_eval.sh <benchmark> <config_name>` (configs under `evaluations/<benchmark>/`); see [Evaluation](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/evaluations/index.html). Reasoning/LLM: see [LLMEvalKit](https://github.com/RLinf/LLMEvalKit).

## Key ideas and plugging in

**Config** (`rlinf/config.py`): `build_config` / `validate_cfg` produce the full DictConfig. New model or env types go into `SupportedModel` / `SupportedEnvType` and validation.

**Cluster and placement:** `ClusterConfig` and strategies in `rlinf/scheduler/placement/`, `rlinf/utils/placement.py`. Placement controls where actor/rollout/env run (one node vs many, GPU vs CPU, heterogeneous).

**Algorithms:** Advantage and loss functions are registered in `rlinf/algorithms/` (registry + decorators); rewards are registered in `rlinf/algorithms/rewards/`. Config keys `algorithm.adv_type` and `algorithm.loss_type` select them. See [Extending RLinf: algorithms, models, envs](#extending-rlinf-algorithms-models-envs) for step-by-step instructions.

**Models (embodied):** Register in `SupportedModel` in `config.py`, implement under `rlinf/models/embodiment/<name>/` (e.g. `BasePolicy`), wire in config and workers. Use add-install-docker-ci-e2e for install/Docker/CI. Details in the extension section below.

**Environments:** Register in `SupportedEnvType` and `get_env_cls()` in `rlinf/envs/__init__.py`, implement under `rlinf/envs/<name>/`. Use add-install-docker-ci-e2e and add-example-doc-model-env for install and docs. Details below.

**Workers:** Subclass `Worker`, implement `initialize` and your API, launch with `create_group(...).launch(...)`. Use `self.log_info` / `log_warning` / `log_error`; no print.

**Runners:** They own the training loop. New task type = new runner + entry script that builds Cluster, placement, worker groups, and calls the runner.

## Extending RLinf: algorithms, models, envs

### New algorithms (advantage, loss, reward)

**Advantage function**

- Implement a function that takes the same keyword args as existing ones (e.g. `rewards`, `values`, `dones`, `gamma`, `loss_mask`, …) and returns `(advantages, returns)`. See `rlinf/algorithms/advantages.py` (e.g. `compute_gae_advantages_and_returns`) for signatures.
- Register it: `from rlinf.algorithms.registry import register_advantage` then `@register_advantage("my_adv")` on your function. The name is case-normalized to lowercase.
- In config YAML set `algorithm.adv_type: my_adv`. Actor workers call `calculate_adv_and_returns(adv_type=...)` which dispatches via `get_adv_and_returns(name)`.
- For non-GAE styles (e.g. GRPO, Reinforce++), `rlinf/algorithms/utils.py` may need to compute scores first; check how `adv_type` is used in `calculate_adv_and_returns` and in the actor worker.

**Policy loss**

- Implement a function that accepts the kwargs passed by the actor (e.g. `logprobs`, `old_logprobs`, `advantages`, `clip_ratio_low`, `clip_ratio_high`, `loss_mask`, …) and returns `(loss_tensor, metrics_dict)`. See `rlinf/algorithms/losses.py` (e.g. `compute_ppo_actor_loss`, `compute_ppo_actor_critic_loss`, `compute_grpo_actor_loss_fn`).
- Register: `from rlinf.algorithms.registry import register_policy_loss` then `@register_policy_loss("my_loss")`.
- In config set `algorithm.loss_type: my_loss`. For PPO-style actor+critic you need a critic and value loss; the unified entry is `policy_loss(loss_type=..., **kwargs)` in `registry.py`. Add validation in `rlinf/config.py` if your loss has special requirements (e.g. `validate_cfg` already checks `loss_type == "actor_critic"` for value head).

**Reward**

- Add a reward class (e.g. under `rlinf/algorithms/rewards/<domain>/`) that matches the interface expected by the reward worker (e.g. callable or class with a clear contract for prompt/completions/ids).
- In `rlinf/algorithms/rewards/__init__.py`: import the class, then `register_reward("my_reward", MyRewardClass)`. The registry is `reward_registry`; lookup via `get_reward_class(name)`.
- Wire the reward name in config and in the runner/reward worker so the correct class is instantiated and used. For reasoning/agent tasks the config path may be under `reward.path` or similar.

### New embodied model

- **Registration:** In `rlinf/config.py`, add a new value to the `SupportedModel` enum: `MY_MODEL = ("my_model", "embodied")`. Use `get_supported_model(model_type)` in validation so `model.model_type: my_model` is accepted.
- **Implementation:** Create a package under `rlinf/models/embodiment/my_model/`. For policies that fit the embodied actor interface, inherit from `rlinf.models.embodiment.base_policy.BasePolicy` and implement `default_forward` and `predict_action_batch`; add other forward types (e.g. `sac_forward`, `crossq_forward`) if the algorithm needs them. For HuggingFace-based VLAs, follow the pattern in the docs: register config and processor in `rlinf/models/__init__.py` (`get_model_config_and_processor`), then implement an action model that wraps generation and optional value head.
- **Config and workers:** Ensure `build_config` / default configs provide the right `model.model_type`, checkpoint paths, and any model-specific options. Actor and rollout workers already branch on `cfg.actor.model.model_type` / `cfg.rollout.model.model_type`; add branches or a factory so your model is instantiated and used. For FSDP+HuggingFace, see the [new model (FSDP) tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/extending/new_model_fsdp.html); for Megatron there is a separate [new model (Megatron) tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/extending/new_model_megatron.html).
- **Install and CI:** If the model needs extra deps or a dedicated venv, add it to `requirements/install.sh` (e.g. `SUPPORTED_MODELS`, and an `install_my_model()` or branch in the model switch). For Docker and e2e: use the skill `.agents/skills/add-install-docker-ci-e2e` (install script, Dockerfile stage, CI job, e2e config under `tests/e2e_tests/embodied/`).

### New environment

- **Registration:** In `rlinf/envs/__init__.py`, add a member to `SupportedEnvType`: e.g. `MY_ENV = "my_env"`. In `get_env_cls(env_type, env_cfg=None, ...)` add an `elif env_type == SupportedEnvType.MY_ENV:` branch that imports your env class and returns it (lazy import to avoid loading heavy deps at import time). If the env needs a task id (like IsaacLab), use `env_cfg` and document the expected shape.
- **Implementation:** Create `rlinf/envs/my_env/` with at least one module defining a gym-style env (e.g. `gymnasium.Env`): `reset`, `step`, and the usual attributes (`observation_space`, `action_space`). Follow the [new environment tutorial](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst_source/extending/new_env.html) for the expected structure (e.g. vectorized `num_envs`, `group_size`, `ret_device`). If your env uses custom action formatting, add a branch in `rlinf/envs/action_utils.py` in `prepare_actions(env_type, ...)` so rollout/workers pass correctly shaped actions.
- **Config:** Set `env.train.env_type` and `env.eval.env_type` to the string value of your enum (e.g. `my_env`). Add any env-specific defaults or validation in `rlinf/config.py` (e.g. `validate_cfg` already has env-specific checks for ManiSkill, Behavior, etc.; add similar ones if needed).
- **Install and docs:** For install/Docker/CI, use `.agents/skills/add-install-docker-ci-e2e` (add env to `SUPPORTED_ENVS`, install logic, e2e config). For example docs and RST, use `.agents/skills/add-example-doc-model-env`.

## Style and contributing

### Engineering and review preferences

Use these preferences when designing, refactoring, implementing, or reviewing
RLinf:

- Preserve behavior before simplifying an implementation. Trace the complete
  call path and compare every affected backend, driver, environment, and task
  with the baseline. Treat a difference as intentional only when it is named,
  documented, and tested. Do not call a parameter or field vestigial until its
  builders, defaulting paths, serialization, and runtime consumers have been
  checked.
- Prefer small, explicit, composable abstractions. Give each concept one clear
  responsibility and one stable name; avoid parallel vocabularies, convenience
  APIs that conceal ownership, and dynamic machinery that a direct constructor
  or method can express. Use a registry when independently developed components
  need extension without adding branches to a central factory.
- Design invalid states out of the API when practical. Resource ownership,
  lifecycle order, partial-failure rollback, cleanup, and reconnect behavior
  should be explicit. Cleanup must be idempotent, and a resource must have one
  clear owner.
- Optimize public APIs for developers who do not know the scheduler or hardware
  internals. Keep the common local path direct; introduce remote placement,
  process boundaries, and resource sharing only when the task requires them.
  Public names, accepted input types, return types, and constructor forms must be
  discoverable from type hints and docstrings.
- Evaluate an abstraction through composition and extension, not only through
  its smallest example. A new component should combine with existing components
  without special-case wiring and should work through the same user-facing API
  in local and remote configurations.
- Review the whole affected surface, not only the newest diff. For cross-cutting
  refactors, inspect every implementation, handle, builder, task, environment,
  test, and documentation path that participates in the contract.
- Verify contracts at the appropriate layers: focused regression tests,
  reusable conformance suites, mock SDK tests, local/remote parity checks, and
  end-to-end tests where hardware or integration behavior matters.
- Keep docstrings and comments concise and natural. Document the public
  contract, invariants, ownership, and non-obvious reasons; do not narrate the
  implementation, repeat the signature, advertise the design, or mention an
  absent dependency unless that fact changes how a caller uses the code.

### Where a test goes

`tests/unit_tests/` holds one file per core component, named for the component:
`test_comm.py`, `test_worker.py`, `test_placement.py`, `test_channel.py`,
`test_cluster_config.py`, `test_weight_syncer.py`, `test_robotics.py`,
`test_real_env.py`, `test_data.py`, `test_models.py`, `test_utils.py`. A fix
or a feature adds its cases to the file for the component it touches.

Do not add a file per change. A new file needs a new component, not a new bug:
`test_<the_fix_i_just_made>.py` is the thing this rule exists to prevent, and a
reviewer should ask for it to be folded into the component's file. The same goes
for a file named after a symptom, a platform, or a single function.

Test the component through the contract a caller uses. A test that reaches past
that contract into private attributes pins the implementation rather than the
behaviour, and breaks on refactors that changed nothing a caller can see. Where
a value is only observable inside the implementation -- a unit conversion, a
wire format -- test it at the layer that owns it, and let the layer above assert
what it can see.

Mocks describe the world outside RLinf: vendor SDKs, hardware, remote services.
`tests/robot_mocks/` is the shared set for robots. A test whose body is mostly
mock setup is usually asserting that the mocks were called, which no future
regression will fail. Prefer a real object, a fake at the process edge, or no
test at all.

Delete a test that has stopped earning its place. Coverage of a line is not the
point; catching a regression is. If you cannot say which change would break a
test, it is not protecting anything.

### Writing and communication

These rules apply to all language communication in the project, including
documentation, issues and pull requests, review comments, design discussions,
release notes, commit messages, and user-facing replies.

- Treat narrative continuity as a basic requirement for every article and
  substantive explanation, not a convention limited to code documentation. The
  first prose sentence states directly what the page explains, enables, routes,
  or lets the reader look up; do not postpone that purpose behind background.
  The rest of the opening establishes the reader's situation, result, scope, and
  reading order; each section connects to the state established before it;
  paragraphs form a dependency chain; and examples are introduced and
  interpreted. When teaching an interface, explain its operations in caller
  order, including the relevant inputs, returns, and lifecycle effects. Indexes
  and reference pages may do this compactly, but are not exempt from a clear
  purpose and deliberate order.
- Use natural, professional technical language. Write like an engineer explaining
  a system clearly: neither casual developer chat nor formal bureaucracy. Avoid
  colloquial phrases such as “看看长什么样”, “等需要时再看”, and “不用跟着改”, as
  well as canned phrases such as “本文旨在”, “本节将”, and “进行相关操作”.
- Explain before naming. Start from the concrete situation, state the relevant
  distinction in ordinary language, introduce the exact class, method, field,
  config, or API name, connect it to one example, and add edge cases only after
  the normal path is clear. Headings must be understandable before their sections
  are read; do not introduce an unexplained implementation term in a heading.
- Guide readers from common use to implementation detail. Show the normal local
  workflow first, then a common extension, composition with existing components,
  remote or distributed use, and finally ownership or scheduler internals. Do
  not make the table of contents mirror an internal class hierarchy.
- Use examples that complete a real workflow. When explaining an extensible
  abstraction, show how the new component composes with an existing one, how a
  caller reads or controls it, and how it participates in the relevant task or
  environment. An isolated class definition is not sufficient.
- Treat technical accuracy as part of writing quality. Check signatures, types,
  return values, lifecycle behavior, configuration names, and call sites against
  the code. If an API accepts two related types, explain what each represents and
  why both are accepted before using them interchangeably in examples.
- Write English directly and precisely. Prefer concrete nouns and verbs, vary
  sentence and paragraph shape, and avoid chatty transitions, promotional
  summaries, and formulaic prose.
- Write Chinese according to natural Chinese logic rather than mirroring English
  clause order. Use clear, restrained written technical language, full-width
  punctuation, and one space between Chinese and English terms or numbers.
- Keep English and Chinese pages equivalent in meaning and structure without
  translating sentence by sentence.
- Keep familiar developer terms in English when translation sounds unusual or
  makes the code harder to search, including `policy`, `key`, `value`, `mapping`,
  `endpoint`, `worker`, `binding`, `wrapper`, `mock SDK`, `contract`, `shape`,
  `schema`, and `API`. In RL prose, write `policy`, not “策略”.
- Do not hard-wrap Chinese prose in RST. Keep each prose paragraph or prose list
  item on one source line because reStructuredText renders internal newlines as
  visible spaces. Preserve structural line breaks in headings, directives,
  tables, and code blocks.
- For documentation about adding tasks that run on physical hardware, use “New
  Real-World Tasks” in English and “新增真机任务” in Chinese.

Code identifiers, protocol fields, and literal log or error text still follow
their source definitions. The voice rules in `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` apply to all
project communication; its document structure and RST layout rules apply only to
documentation.

Google Python style; Ruff for lint/format; docstrings and type hints on public APIs. Logging: `rlinf.utils.logging.get_logger()` or Workers’ `self.log_*`. Config YAML: static values only; no computed fields; don’t overwrite user-facing fields in code. Commits: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), ~72-char subject, imperative; every commit `Signed-off-by:` (e.g. `git commit -s`). PRs: same title format, fill template, link issues; for perf-sensitive changes include test results. New behavior needs tests (unit or e2e); if e2e needs GPUs/hardware, document and skip appropriately in CI. Full details: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
