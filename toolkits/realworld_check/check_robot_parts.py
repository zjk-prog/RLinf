"""Check that a robot composes, connects, observes, and lets go.

This is the bench counterpart to the unit tests: they cover composition with
fake hardware, and this runs the same path against the real thing. It reports
what a robot is made of, which connection backs each part, where each was
placed, and what every part observes -- then disconnects and checks that
nothing still claims to be connected.

Run it after changing a part, a connection, or how a robot is composed::

    python -m toolkits.realworld_check.check_robot_parts Franka \\
        --arg robot_ip=10.0.0.1 --arg node_rank=1

    python -m toolkits.realworld_check.check_robot_parts DualFranka \\
        --arg left_robot_ip=10.0.0.1 --arg right_robot_ip=10.0.0.2

Values are parsed as Python literals when they look like one, so
``--arg node_rank=1`` passes an int and ``--arg robot_ip=10.0.0.1`` a string.

Exit code is 0 when every part connects, observes and releases; 1 otherwise.
